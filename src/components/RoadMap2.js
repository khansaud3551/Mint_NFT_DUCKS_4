                    We have a simple goal in mind; to adopt a community first
                    approach that holds a safe-space for all members. The
                    process is simple but efficient. Peace, love and kindness
                    toward others is a big part of who we are. That‚Äôs why our
                    main objective is built around ‚Äúhow much value can we bring
                    to our community?‚Äù. As this is a community driven project,
                    we will be onboarding enthusiastic members of the community
                    from day one. we plan on hosting AMA‚Äôs, organizing events,
                    and maintaining 100% transparency at all times.

                    As we began brainstorming a roadmap, we knew we wanted to
                    create a sense of excitement and suspense by giving every
                    member of our community something to look forward to. If you

                    - 20 % of minting price will go to the project team to
                    support this project on longer terms.

                  <p>
                    - 80 % of minting price will go to the charity firm
                    edhi-pige where the charity firm will support at least 1,000
                    family by starting small businesses for the families.

                  <p>
                    - Since the firm is helping families in starting businesses
                    there will be a % shares in return to the firm which will go
                    back to token holders as staking reward a (monthly passive
